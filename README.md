**Luminescence (Use R!)**
**Data Analysis and simulations using R**

**Springer, 2021**


For a detailed Table of Contents and a Listing of the R codes, see the included pdf file:

**HOW THE R CODES ARE ORGANIZED**

The book contains 99 scripts, which are self contained and ready to run. The codes are organized in folders by chapter, and each folder contains the R codes, and a pdf file 
which shows the expected output from the codes. 
  
For example, _Chapter 2 folder_ contains the file
   
   _Chapter 2_Code_outputs_Pagonis_book.pdf_

which shows the expected output from the codes in this folder.

__________________________________

**DATA FILES USED BY THE R CODES**

In addition, the folders may contain some data files (.txt or .asc format). These data files are used by some of the R codes, so they should always be located in the appropriate working directory.

For example,  _Chapter 2 folder_ contains the file

   _lbodata.txt_

which is used by some of the codes in Chapter 2.

**GENERAL INFORMATION OF THE R CODES**

I have kept the number of required external R packages intentionally
at a minimum, so that newcomers to R can follow the R codes easily.

All figures in this book were produced using the R scripts in this repository, so that
users know immediately what to expect when they run the scripts. 

Experienced programmers of R will quickly find out that they can improve
the R codes given here, and it is of course possible to make the codes
more compact and elegant. However, I chose to provide R codes which are
simple and clear, and which can be easily modified for the purposes of the
reader, rather than attempting to create compact codes which may be difficult
to follow and modify. 

Several chapters are dedicated to Monte Carlo (MC) methods, which are used to simulate the luminescence processes during
the irradiation, heating and optical stimulation of solids, for a wide variety
of materials. 
Throughout the book, both localized and delocalized transition luminescence
models are simulated using the new R-package **_RLumCarlo_**.

I hope you will find the scripts useful and that you will enjoy running and modifying the various files.
If you find that some script is not clear or has inaccuracies, kindly let me know at

Enjoy!
