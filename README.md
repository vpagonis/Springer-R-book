This repository contains the R codes from the book:


**Luminescence Data Analysis and simulations using R**

**by Vasilis Pagonis**

**Springer, 2021**


The book contains 99 R codes, which are self contained and ready to run. The codes are organized in folders by chapter, and each folder contains the R codes and a pdf file 
which shows the expected output from the codes. 
  
   For example, Chapter 2 folder contains a file
   
   _Chapter 2_Code_outputs_Pagonis_book.pdf_

which shows the expected output from the codes in this folder.

Several chapters are dedicated to Monte Carlo
(MC) methods, which are used to simulate the luminescence processes during
the irradiation, heating and optical stimulation of solids, for a wide variety
of materials. 

Throughout the book, both localized and delocalized transition
models are simulated using the new R-package RLumCarlo.

Experienced programmers of R will certainly nd out that they can improve
the R codes given here, and it is of course possible to make the codes
more compact and elegant. However, I chose to provide R codes which are
simple and clear, and which can be easily modied for the purposes of the
reader, rather than attempting to create compact codes which may be dicult
to follow. 

I have kept the number of required external R packages intentionally
at a minimum, so that newcomers to R can follow the R codes easily.

All gures in this book were produced using the R codes in the book, so that
users know immediately what to expect when they run the codes. Additional
drawings for the various luminescence models in the book were drawn using
Inkscape, and the book was produced overall using LyX.
